      <img class="img-responsive" src="./assets/images/headshot.jpg">
      <p>I was born and raised in Lincolnwood, IL and have been living in Illinois my entire life. In 2015, I graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a degree in Accountancy. Living and attending school in Downtown Chicago was a great experience as I met lifelong friends during that time. I truly understand why Chicago is one of the greatest cities in the United States.</p>
        
      <p>After college, I began working at State Farm for about half a year, and then began a career in logistics at Khan Trans. At this company, I handled exhibition freight for tradeshows across America. I executed ocean/air imports and exports while also handling customs clearance and inland freight. I developed skills at this company that will carry over with me to whichever field I go into.</p>
        
      <p>Around this time last year, I spoke with a friend from college that had just finished this Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. It immediately sparked interest in me and began doing research about possible careers after learning how to code. After about a year about contemplating a change in career, I decided to take a leap of faith and attend this bootcamp. I hope to learn the skills necessary at this bootcamp to catapult me into a career in tech as I transition into the next phase of my career.</p>
